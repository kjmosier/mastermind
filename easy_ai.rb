=begin brainstorm easy ai

runs 0000, 1111, 2222, etc  in random order.
from there gets how many of each numbers
from there tries to lock in to rnrp

  locks in by testing with non inclusive numbers.
   1xxx
   x1xx
   xx1x







=begin






peg holes   RN?   RN?  RN? RN?

Will switch to RN or RNRP

numbers [true, true, true, true, true, true]

will switch to false if determined wrong

generate random guess...

guess = logic_switch
